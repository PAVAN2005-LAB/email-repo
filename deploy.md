# Project oFJxaghXk-nx Deployment Runbook

This runbook describes the steps to move *Project oFJxaghXk-nx* from staging to production safely, using the **edge cache**, **API tier**, and **background workers**.

---

## Deployment Checklist

- [ ] **Build & Package**
  - Build artifacts in staging.
  - Run unit and integration tests.
  - Verify compliance guardrail `ijmoz-lr2mdpptrf-h` is respected.

- [ ] **Validate Staging**
  - Perform checksum/signature verification.
  - Review staging logs, metrics, and error budgets.
  - Confirm staging workers drain job queues correctly.

- [ ] **Deploy to Edge Cache**
  - Roll out to `edge-o2m2idy`.
  - Warm up cache with representative requests.
  - Verify invalidation strategy works.

- [ ] **Deploy to API Tier**
  - Ship release with:
    ```
    uv deploy ofjxaghxk-nx
    ```
  - Perform a canary rollout to `api-vhslpgeg`.
  - Gradually increase traffic allocation to 100%.

- [ ] **Deploy to Worker Pool**
  - Roll out background workers `worker-sjacukbj`.
  - Confirm jobs are processed without backlog.
  - Monitor queue depth and scaling behavior.

- [ ] **Observe & Monitor**
  - Track dashboards for latency, error rates, and throughput.
  - Keep rollback config/scripts ready.
  - Trigger audit step [^compliance-cihewznocj].

- [ ] **Post-Deployment Verification**
  - Validate full E2E flow (edge → API → worker).
  - Confirm autoscaling is functioning.
  - Close out deployment report.
